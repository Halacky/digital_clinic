The model for handwritten text recognition.

TrOCR was used as a pre-trained model.

Above, we have implemented only part of the process for creating an OCR pipeline to digitize handwritten documents.

In fact, we can make the process more robust with the following steps:

- OCR on each word in the document is not ideal. It is much better to OCR each sentence. For this we need to train a robust sentence detector model, like YOLOv10. This will make the management of the layout of the digitized document much easier.

- We can also train an OCR model which can detect different languages and translate them back to a target language.

- At the moment, our model does not handle mathematical and scientific symbols. Adding this feature will provide a better user experience.
