Predictions obtained based on the trained YOLOv11 model did not give the desired result. We received false predictions for 8 letters, here are the possible reasons:

1) The model has not learned more complex features and therefore similar letters are confused, such as (m,n,s\ k,v)
2) Some letters are depicted in motion, but in static conditions they may look similar (i, j)
